title: Marine Environment Monitoring Platform
---

MEMP (Marine Environment Monitoring Platform) is a platform for monitoring, cataloguing and
analysing data from marine environments. MEMP can be used to keep up-to-date on key environmental
factors and enable you to better monitor and respond to changes in the environment.

MEMP is built on a full stack of open source software and is meant to be self-hosted. MEMP is
essentially a bit of glue code and documentation for creating a cohesive monitoring platform for
marine data.

how to start setting up MEMP.
